I'm a passionate learner with dad energy excited about building innovative solutions and exploring new technologies. I enjoy working with modern web platforms, AI/ML, and developing tools that make people's lives easier. I am father raising two kiddos, sadly the system/user prompts don't seem to work on them(joking).
